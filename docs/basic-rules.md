All UNIHACK competitors must follow these Basic Rules when competing. Failure to comply with the Basic Rules may see you and/or your team removed from the competition and/or expelled from the venue.

### Rule 1

Teams can have up to four people. Each member of a team must be a student studying at an undergraduate, honours, or postgraduate course at an accredited university; or studying at a recognised TAFE.

**NOTE:** we will be strongly encouraging teams of three and four in order to have Presentation Day run smoothly. If you are in a team of one or two, you will be asked to merge into another team or add another member. We will not be asking teams to break up.

### Rule 2

Teams have 24 hours to build a working prototype of your project. There are no restrictions on what form it should take, programming languages or devices. You must build your project during the allocated time and at the venue. You cannot have any remote participants.

### Rule 3

Any code must be published in a repository that is publicly accessible. You are free to use whatever code repository service you want (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab).

### Rule 4

Teams must not work on existing projects during the event. Teams must also not come into the competition with any code already written, or any part of the build completed. You are free to conduct research and generate ideas before the competition, however.

### Rule 5

Any third-party material used must be legally licensed and is available to the public to download or buy. You may purchase material, tools and equipment for the competition, but at your own expense. **You will not be reimbursed by UNIHACK or WIRED Monash for any purchases you made during the competition**.

### Rule 6

You agree to follow the Code of Conduct and not act in an inappropriate manner. A copy the Code of Conduct is included.
