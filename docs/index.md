# The UNIHACK Competitor Handbook

Welcome to the UNIHACK Competitor Handbook. This handbook will contain everything you need to know about this year's competition - including schedule, submission process and safety information.

You are currently reading **v1.0.2** of the UNIHACK Competitor Handbook.

You will be provided a printed version of the booklet on the day. However, some sections of the handbook will be found online only - such as information about hardware and APIs.

This organisers have the right to make changes to the Competitor Handbook that
may affect the format of the competition - such as, but not limited to,
clarifying any ambiguous sections in this document. You will be notified of any
major changes to the document, but it is up to you to ensure you read the
handbook to follow any rules.
