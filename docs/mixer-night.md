# Mixer Night
![Mixer Night](img/mixernight.png)

Mixer Night returns for another year. It is our way to help competitors find
teammates, discuss hack ideas and meet other students and professionals.

The big news weâ€™ve got for you is that this year, we will also be focusing on
showcasing the different software and hardware products that some of our
sponsors - Accenture, IttyBittyApps, Bosch and Microsoft - will be supplying for
you to utilise within your hack. You will get to learn about them, how to use
them and start thinking about how they can help improve your project.

If you were thinking about using any APIs or hardware tools in your hack, then
Mixer Night will give you a head start in planning your wonderfully magical
hacks.

The Mixer Night begins at 6:30pm on July 25. You can RSVP by clicking the below
link.
