Like last year, we require all teams to post their submission on DevPost.

You must submit your project on DevPost by **3:30pm** on Sunday July 31.
Otherwise, your project will not be considered for judging. You will be notified
by one of the organisers if your project is not on DevPost beforehand.

In addition to details about your project and how you built it, you must also
provide the following:

- A list of all third-party material and APIs, including anything that was
  purchased.
- A link to your repository (as per [Rule 3](../basic-rules.md#rule-3))
- Images and/or screenshots of your project

If you have created a web app, you are free to submit a link to a live working
copy of your project with your submission. However, this is optional and
not required.

## Video
You are *encouraged* to produce a video demonstration of your project. However,
this is optional and not required.

This video must be a no-frills video - that is, no fancy graphics and animations
- and does not exceed two minutes. We highly encourage you use your iPhone or
Android smartphone to record the video.

We also strongly encourage you keep the video up after the event. This will
help us for marketing and promotion of future UNIHACK competitions.

## Submission Tips

We suggest you create your submission at the start of the competition. You can
continue to edit your hackathon submission until the deadline. This will ensure
that you *never forget* to submit your application.

If you plan to submit a video, we advise you to produce the video and upload it
at least an hour before submission. This will ensure that the internet is not
congested.
