# Judging Criteria

The UNIHACK Judging Panel will determine all entries based on the following criteria:

1.	**Originality**

    Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app?
    Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an
    old problem?

2.	**Technical Difficulty**

    Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick
    on an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building
    it?

3.	**Polish and Design**

    Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does
    it work as the creators say? Is it well designed? Our judges will see and/or
    want to use your prototype - so make sure it works!

4.	**Usefulness**
    Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it
    fulfil a real need that people have? While you are not required to prepare a
    business plan, your app should have an audience identified.

Please note that the above judging criteria only applies for the Major Prize.
Teams will be judged on solely on the *Polish and Design* criterion for the Best
Design prize; and on the *Originality* criterion for the Most Creative Idea
prize.

Other prizes will have their own judging criteria, eligibility requirements and
judges.
