# Hardware

Planning to do a hardware hack at UNIHACK this year? We ask that you follow these
simple guidelines when building your hack in order to comply with the host venue's
regulations and for everyone's safety.

## Soldering

Soldering is not allowed at the event venue.

## Safety
It should go without saying that if you are soldering, painting, or doing anything with a high current or heavy objects that you do so not intoxicated or under the influence of any substance.

If you require first aid there will be kits located throughout the venue, please alert an organiser and we will assist you. Refer to the emergency contacts at the back of this book for ambulance and police numbers.

## Fire
Do NOT start a fire.

The venue is non smoking so you must smoke outside, not in the beer garden. If you see a fire there are extinguishers located throughout the venue, alert an organiser.

## Electrocution/Burns

If you somehow get severely electrocuted (well done) or see someone electrocute themself RING 000. If you see someone get electrocuted do not put yourself in danger trying to help them, try and find the power supply and turn it off, or get the help of an organiser.

If you or someone else gets burned, refer to the safety section below, but essentially find a tap and run cold water over the burn, and get the assistance of an organiser.

## Extras/Questions

If you have any questions about hardware there is a slack channel called `hardware-questions` that you can join which will be monitored. If you have a safety question, or a question about something in this section, or something not covered in this section please ask the channel or an organiser.
