This year, we have a number of sponsors providing some hardware sensors to our teams to incorporate into their hacks. Teams are advised that there are limited numbers and will be provided on a first-in-first-serve basis.

If you wish to request the use of the following, please fill in this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14v1pVEly_TDCxam_tLszSVz0TB4v5yyGg_If1INsxwk/viewform) with your details or you can request access on the day.

## Bosch

![Bosch Sensors](../img/bosch.jpg "Bosch Sensors")

In order for teams to create ideas with the "Internet of Things" in mind, Bosch has kindly donated to us some sensors for teams to use during the competition: the BME280 Shuttle Board and the BNO055 Arduino Shield.

Please be aware that you will need to provide your own hardware - such as an Arduino and breadboard - to use these sensors.

All documentation can be found in the links below.

**BME280 Shuttle Board**

The BME280 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications where size and low power consumption are key design constraints. The unit combines individual high linearity, high accuracy sensors for pressure, humidity and temperature.

**BNO055 Arduino Shield**

The Arduino 9 Axes Motion Shield is based on the BNO055 absolute orientation sensor from Bosch Sensortec GmbH which integrates a triaxial 14-bit accelerometer, a triaxial 16-bit gyroscope with a range of Â±2000 degrees per second and a triaxial geomagnetic sensor with a 32-bit microcontroller running the BSX3.0 FusionLib software.

## Estimote

![Estimote Beacons](../img/beacons.jpg "Estimote Beacons")

Estimote have kindly donated to us five Proximity Beacons and two Estimote Stickers. Please note: you cannot request for both a Beacon and Sticker.

Estimote Beacons are small, beautifully designed sensors that could be placed anywhere in the physical world. Once installed, e.g. next to an entry door or on product shelves, they start broadcasting tiny radio signals. Estimote Stickers are much smaller versions that can be stuck on items.

For more information about the difference between Beacons and Stickers, please read this comparison guide on [their website](http://developer.estimote.com/nearables/stickers-vs-beacons/). Estimote also have SDKs for both [Android](https://github.com/Estimote/Android-SDK) and [iOS](https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK) - allowing you to integrate them with your mobile app idea.
