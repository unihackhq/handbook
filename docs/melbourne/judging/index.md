# Judging Guidelines

## How is UNIHACK Judged?

In order to decide the winner of the hackathon, UNIHACK has asked five
well-respected members of the industry to judge all entries.

There will be a judge specifically for each of the four criterion of UNIHACK: originality, technical difficulty, design and usefulness. There will also be one “wild card” judge that will get to judge all of the criteria combined.

Unlike most hackathons in Australia, UNIHACK has a 2-stage judging process at Presentation Day (on Sunday) that details as follows:

1.  **Exhibition Stage**: Teams will still present in an expo style format to the judges. The main prize judges will hear your 2-minute “elevator pitch” and will rank you on a scale of 1–5 in their respective criteria. These scores will then be used to select the top 8 teams to move on to the next judging round.

2.  **Presentation Stage**: The top 8 teams selected will be given 3 minutes to pitch their hack to the judges and the rest of the participants, with an additional 2 minutes to answer any final questions from the judges. This stage is only to select the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners.

The judging panel will be broken into groups and will be clearly identified by their Judge badge, which will also specify their judging criteria.

Please be aware that category and minor prize winners will be selected from the overall pool of participating teams and not just the top 8 teams. The judges for these prizes will be roaming around during the exhibition stage. They will not have a Judge badge but will identify themselves as a judge for a certain prize.

## Criteria

The UNIHACK Judging Panel will determine all entries based on the following criteria:

1.  **Originality**

    Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/local app?
    Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an
    old problem?

2.  **Technical Difficulty**

    Is the hack technically interesting or difficult? Is it just some lipstick
    on an API, or were there any technical challenges to surmount when building
    it?

3.  **Polish and Design**

    Is the hack usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does
    it work as the creators say? Is it well designed? Our judges will see and/or
    want to use your prototype - so make sure it works!

4.  **Usefulness**

    Is the hack practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it
    fulfil a real need that people have? While you are not required to prepare a
    business plan, your app should have an audience identified.

Please note that the above judging criteria only applies for the Major Prize. There will be a dedicated judge for each criterion, as well as a "wild card" judge that will judge all the of the criteria.

Teams will be judged solely on the _Polish and Design_ criterion for the Best Design prize; and on the _Originality_ criterion for the Most Creative Idea prize

Other prizes will have their own judging criteria, eligibility requirements and
judges.

## Time With the Judges

In order to ensure that all teams are seen by the judging panel members, we
will be enforcing a time limit each team has with a group of judges. Team will
have only two minutes with the judges at the **Exhibition Stage**,
and they will have a timekeeper to ensure they keep within that limit.

The judges will have access to summary cards that will be created using the
information you provided with your DevPost submission. This means that you can
focus less on the technical details of your project, and more on demonstrating
your project in action.

If you need any assistance with how to use DevPost, feel free to read our
[Submissions](submission.md) guide.
