# How to Submit

Like previous years, we require all teams to post their submission on DevPost.
Our DevPost site can be found at [unihack2017mel.devpost.com](unihack2017mel.devpost.com).

You must submit your project on DevPost by 12pm on Sunday August 6.
Otherwise, your project may not be considered for judging. You will be notified
by one of the organisers if your project is not on DevPost beforehand.

In addition to details about your project and how you built it, you must also
provide the following:
1.	A list of all third-party material and APIs, including anything that was purchased.
2.	A link to your repository (as per Section 2.3 of the rules)
3.	Images and/or screenshots of your project

If you have created a web app, you are free to submit a link to a live working
copy of your project with your submission. However, this is optional and not
required.

You must also fill in the required fields with your DevPost submission to help
us speed up the judging process. The information you provide will be used to
create summary cards for the judges, allowing you to focus on the more important
things during your pitch.

## Video

You are encouraged to produce a video demonstration of your project.
However, this is optional and not required.

This video must be a no-frills video - that is, no fancy graphics and
animations - and does not exceed two minutes. We highly encourage you use your
iPhone or Android smartphone to record the video.

We also strongly encourage you keep the video up after the event. This will help
us for marketing and promotion of future UNIHACK competitions.

## How to submit via DevPost

If you haven't already register yourself on our DevPost page, you will need to
click on the "Register for this hackathon" button. You will be asked to sign in
or create a new DevPost account.

Once logged in, go back to the UNIHACK 2017 DevPost page. Now, click on the
"Enter Submission" button. This is where you can submit your project.

Click on the "Add a new project", and fill in the prompts. Once that is
completed, you can hit the "Save" button. Fill in any additional prompts, then
hit "Submit".

When you hit submit, it doesn't necessarily mean that is your final application
to us. You can go back and edit your submission during the hackathon period. To
edit, go back to the UNIHACK 2017 DevPost page and hit "Manage your submission",
then under your submission click on the "Edit this submission."

If you require any help, feel free to watch this video provided by DevPost on
[how to create your submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCa7QFFthfU).
Alternatively, one of the organisers will be able to help you on the day.

## Submission Tips
We suggest you create your submission at the start of the competition. You can
continue to edit your hackathon submission until the deadline. This will ensure
that you never forget to submit your application.

If you plan to submit a video, we advise you to produce the video and upload it
at least an hour before submission. This will ensure that the internet is
not congested.
