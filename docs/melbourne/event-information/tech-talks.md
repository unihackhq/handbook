# Tech Talks and Workshops

We have a number of tech talks and workshops organised during Saturday afternoon to help you with the competition, gain knowledge and/or refresh existing skills.

These talks are held at the **Plenary**. Please refer to your physical copy of the booklet for a map.

## Schedule

### 2:00PM - REA Group: Working as a woman in IT

Working in the IT industry today is hard, but it is even harder if you are a woman. There is still lots of “old school thinking" that women face daily. This talk is a survival guide based on real-life stories and different challenges from women of different ages, cultural backgrounds and roles in the Australian IT industry.

Like any survival guide, this one provides you with the essential information to help you identify and overcome the most frequently encountered hazards. Each chapter contains useful tips, instructions and practical advice on a particular issue so you can implement the skills and techniques even under the most stressful circumstances. From the hiring process to promotions and corporate events, you'll have the tools to survive.

### 2:50PM - Coles: Landing Technology change in a fast pace retailer

Find out how Coles is embracing the ever-changing world of technology and ensuring how they keep up to date.

### 3:40PM - Odecee: An introduction to virtual reality development

A brief overview of HTC Vive hardware and an intro to getting started with developing simulations and games for VR with the Unity engine


### 4:20PM - Microsoft: How to deploy using Azure

Deploying your website to Azure –take code that runs on your computer, share and collaborate with your team, and deploy it to the web easily and (mostly) for free.

### 5:20PM - Bosch: From Things to the Internet of Things – How Bosch Sensors Enable the Industrial Internet

We will do a talk at the event that will be a short history of Bosch in relation to sensor technology and will end with some example of how sensors can be used in the IoT to solve business problems.
