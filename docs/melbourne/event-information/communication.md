# Communication Information

## UNIHACK App

This year at UNIHACK, we're introducing a brand new platform that allows competitors to form teams and submit their ideas. The new UNIHACK app and website have been specially developed to allow teams to:

- Communicate their ideas more clearly for judging;
- Allow competitors to form teams;
- Keep track of tickets; and
- Receive up-to-date notifications prior to and during the event.

The app will also be used by the judges to gather basic information about your project prior to judging and to connect competitors with mentors who will be walking around during the day - so the more potent the information you submit on the app, the more help you can receive during the event.

The app is available on both Android and iOS on their respective app stores.

## Slack

We use Slack throughout the competition to allow the organisers to communicate
important messages to attendees, and allows you to have a way to communicate with
your team and mentors.

You can use the following channels for specific purposes:

- `#general-questions` general questions for competitors, mentors or organising
  committee
- `#random` post some hand-crafted memes
- `#ask-a-mentor` ask mentors a question
- `#software-questions` ask software-specific questions
- `#hardware-questions` ask hardware-specific questions

Teams can also create private channels so they can communicate with their team
members.

To create an account with Slack, visit [https://slack.unihack.net/](https://slack.unihack.net/)
and sign up with your email address. You should get an invite to join the
UNIHACKers Slack group.

## Snapchat

Like all the new cool kids in town, this year you will be able to find our very own UNIHACK Melbourne 2018 Snapchat filter! Make sure to send us your snaps using it (username: unihackmelb) - itâ€™ll count as an entry for the Social Media prize!
