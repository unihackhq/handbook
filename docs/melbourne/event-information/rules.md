    relax this restriction at their discretion.

### Section 2: Projects

1.  Teams have 24 hours to build a prototype. There are no restrictions on what
    form it should take, programming languages or devices.

    whatever reason, the team is unable to work at the venue, they may ask for a
    special exemption to work in an alternative venue.

    provide this link in your submission.

1.  All competitors agree to follow the Code of Conduct and not act in an
    inappropriate manner.

2.  If you are asked to stop and leave the venue by the organisers, you are are
    expected to comply immediately.

3.  Failure to follow the Code of Conduct will see the organisers take any action
    that they see as appropriate. This may include calling in the police and reporting
    the behaviour.

### Section 4: Breaches

1.  The Organisers reserve the right to ask teams to present their code for review if
    they suspect their project or prototype breaches the Competition Rules.

1.  A breach of the Competition Rules will result in you and/or your team
    being disqualified from the competition. This may also include you and/or your
    team being removed from the venue.

2.  Repeated breaches or a serious breach may result in you and/or your team being
    banned from competing in any UNIHACK competition in the future.
