# Participant Information

## The Gist

To give you a general idea of how to prepare for UNIHACK, here are the most basic instructions:

1.  Build a prototype. It can be purely software or involving hardware - your choice.

2.  There is no theme. You can come up with any idea for any problem in any field. All hacks are accepted, be it an innovative solution or a simple game. Be creative.

3.  Eyes on the prize. If you’re aiming for the main prize, then you should know that the judging criteria is originality, technical difficulty, design and usefulness (detailed in page 13). Otherwise, you may choose to build a hack specifically aimed towards one of the category or sponsor prizes, so make sure to familiarise yourself with all the available prizes beforehand.

## Arrival

All participants should aim to arrive between 9:00am and 10:00am on Saturday
July 28. This allows us to get you registered and collect some cool swag from
our sponsors.

There will also be a Careers Fair, where you can ask questions from some
of our sponsors about any upcoming internship or graduate programs they may
have.

## Smoking and Alcohol

The event and the venue has a no smoking policy. This applies to cigarettes,
pipes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and vaporisers, and any method of
consuming tobacco.

If you need to smoke, please advise one of the orgainsers. If this occurs when
doors close, then you will need to be buzzed back in. One of the organisers will
provide you with a number to escort you out and back in the building.

The event is a non-alcoholic event. Any alcoholic drinks will be confiscated by
volunteers and/or the organisers. You will also be refused entry and/or asked to
leave the venue if you are under the influence of alcohol.

## Showers & Toilets

There are showers and toilets at the venue. We strongly encourage competitors to
make use of these facilities during the competition. If you are planning to use
the shower facilities in the venue, we ask that you take a quick shower to
prevent a long wait for the showers.

If you need directions, please ask a volunteer and they will point you to the
right direction.

## Sleeping

If you plan to sleep at the venue, please bring your own sleeping bag, pillow and other sleeping equipment. As the lights in the entire venue are controlled centrally, there will not be a designated dark area for sleeping; and while we will be providing a limited number of eye masks you can use for optimal comfort, we do advise that you try to bring your own.

We ask that competitors that plan to work late at night to refrain from making any loud noises between 1am and 6am.

If you prefer to take a shower at home or sleep on a bed, you will be given the option to leave for the night between 8:00pm and 10:00pm on Saturday night. Please be aware that once you leave the premises for the night, you cannot work on any part of your project from home or hotel. You must also return to the venue between 6:00am and 9:00am on Sunday morning.

## Leaving the Venue

You are free to leave and return to the venue during the daytime.

You are not allowed to leave and return to the venue during the night without
the permission of the organisers, or under the following exceptions:

- Leaving to return home (between 8pm and 10pm)
- Leaving to have a smoke
- Family or medical emergencies
- Quitting the competition

In all cases, you will be required to hand in your badge to the front desk
before leaving. This will ensure we know that you have left the venue. In
addition, upon leaving, you are not allowed to continue working on your
prototype until you return to the venue.

## Ownership of Code & Assets

Any intellectual property (e.g. code, images, audio) that you and/or your team
create during UNIHACK 2017 belongs to you. We may use your project to assist us
with marketing in future years, but we will always seek to permission from you
and/or your team in order to do so.

## Tools and Hardware

If you are planning on using any hardware materials or tools in your project, please refer to the [Hardware](melbourne/hardware.md) section of this handbook for our safety rules and precautions.

Moreover, a number of software and hardware tools will be supplied by our sponsor companies for participants to use on the day. The [Provided Tools](melbourne/provided-tools.md) section of this handbook will have the full list of what’s provided.

## BYO Food & Drink

You are free to bring your own food and drink to the event. It is worth noting
that this year, we have teamed up with Red Bull to provide you with an unlimited
supply of free energy drinks for the entire duration of the competition!

Furthermore, we ask that you do not bring strong-smelling or pungent food to the
venue. Please also ensure that any containers that you bring are clearly
labelled with your name.

## Social Media and Photography

We strongly encourage everyone to post messages and images on social media during UNIHACK 2018. We ask that you use the hashtag #UNIHACK2018. Please respect people’s wishes if they do not wish to be photographed.
