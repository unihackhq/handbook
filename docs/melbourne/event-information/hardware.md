# Hardware

Planning to do a hardware hack at UNIHACK this year? We ask that you follow these
simple guidelines when building your hack in order to comply with the host venue's
regulations and for everyone's safety.

## Soldering

There is a dedicated soldering space in the Bear Garden at the Gazebo. Due to fire
safety regulations, we are not able to let competitors solder inside the venue.

If you are planning on soldering, please use the proper safety equipment - including
safety glasses and closed shoes. If you have not soldered before, there will be a
short workshop outlining the basic techniques and skills needed.

## Glue/Painting
If your project requires intense gluing, adhesive, or painting you must do this
outside near the soldering station (using acrylic and water-based paint is fine inside). There are a lot of people inside in a building not designed to ventilate fumes so this is a very important point.

No eating or drinking while gluing, soldering, painting, or anything else where your food can easily be contaminated. (FYI solder, paint, and glue contains carcinogens, poisons, and other bad things to have floating around you during a hackathon)

## Safety
It should go without saying that if you are soldering, painting, or doing anything with a high current or heavy objects that you do so not intoxicated or under the influence of any substance.

If you require first aid there will be kits located throughout the venue, please alert an organiser and we will assist you. Refer to the emergency contacts at the back of this book for ambulance and police numbers.

## Fire
Do NOT start a fire.

The venue is non smoking so you must smoke outside, not in the beer garden. If you see a fire there are extinguishers located throughout the venue, alert an organiser.

## Electrocution/Burns

If you somehow get severely electrocuted (well done) or see someone electrocute themself RING 000. If you see someone get electrocuted do not put yourself in danger trying to help them, try and find the power supply and turn it off, or get the help of an organiser.

If you or someone else gets burned, refer to the safety section below, but essentially find a tap and run cold water over the burn, and get the assistance of an organiser.

## Extras/Questions

If you have any questions about hardware there is a slack channel called `hardware-questions` that you can join which will be monitored. If you have a safety question, or a question about something in this section, or something not covered in this section please ask the channel or an organiser.
