# Hardware Safety

Planning to do a hardware hack at UNIHACK this year? We ask that you follow these
simple guidelines when building your hack in order to comply with the host venue's
regulations and for everyone's safety.

## Soldering

There are dedicated soldering spaces at the venue. Please ask one of our volunteers if you need help locating these areas.

If you are planning on soldering, please use the proper safety equipment - including safety glasses and closed shoes. There will also be a short soldering workshop outlining the basic techniques and skills needed.

Moreover, if your project requires intense gluing, adhesive or painting, you must do this in a safe area as advised by our volunteers (this excludes acrylic and water-based paint).

For safety purposes, it is crucial that you do not eat or drink while gluing, soldering, painting or dealing with any other toxic substances.

## Emergency

If you require first aid, there will be kits located throughout the venue. Please alert an organiser and we will assist you. Refer to the emergency contacts at the back of this book for ambulance and police numbers.

## Safety

It should go without saying that if you are soldering, painting, or doing anything with a high current or heavy objects that you do so not intoxicated or under the influence of any substance.

If you require first aid there will be kits located throughout the venue, please alert an organiser and we will assist you. Refer to the emergency contacts at the back of this book for ambulance and police numbers.

## Fire

Do NOT start a fire.

If you do notice a fire, there are extinguishers located throughout the venue. Please also alert an organiser immediately.

## Electrocution/Burns

If you somehow get severely electrocuted (well done) or see someone electrocute themself RING 000. If you see someone get electrocuted do not put yourself in danger trying to help them, try and find the power supply and turn it off, or get the help of an organiser.

If you or someone else gets burned, refer to the safety section below, but essentially find a tap and run cold water over the burn, and get the assistance of an organiser.

## Extras/Questions

If you have any questions about hardware there is a slack channel called `hardware-questions` that you can join which will be monitored. If you have a safety question, or a question about something in this section, or something not covered in this section please ask the channel or an organiser.
