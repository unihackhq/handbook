# Venue

This year's competition will be held at Monash Business School, which is located
at:

Level 7, 271 Collins Street  
Melbourne VIC 3000  

It is strongly advised that you use the Flinders Lane entrance (at the back),
as that is where the lifts are located.

## How do I get there?

As the venue is near Flinders Street Station, the best way of getting to 271
Collins Street is by train or tram. If taking a train, simply use the Elizabeth
Street or Degraves Street exits, and turn on Flinders Lane. There will be an
entrance to 271 Collins Street on that side.
