## Arrival

All participants should aim to arrive between 9:00am and 10:00am on Saturday
July 30. This allows us to get you registered and collect some cool swag from
our sponsors.

There will also be a Careers Fair, where you can ask questions from some
of our sponsors about any upcoming internship or graduate programs they may
have.

## Slack
This year, we are also introducing Slack to all competitors. This will allow the organisers to communicate to all attendees, and allow you to have a way to communicate with your team and mentors. There will be four channels open to the public:

-	&#35;general: used by the organisers to update all attendees
-	&#35;random: open to all for random chat
-	&#35;request-a-mentor: for all mentor requests or questions
-	&#35;qanda: questions to the organisers

All attendees should have received a Slack invite to the email account they used to register for UNIHACK 2016. If you did not receive an invite, ask one of the volunteers and they can add you to the Slack channel.

You can find the UNIHACK 2016 Slack at [unihackmelbourne.slack.com](unihackmelbourne.slack.com)

## Rooms

We ask that all participants **DO NOT** close the door if they are in one of the rooms used for hacking. While we understand this might be annoying for some competitors, there are some rooms that use locks that we do not have the code for. Accidentally locking those doors will mean you might have to wait until Monday to retrieve your stuff.

If you plan to leave and want to leave your stuff, one of the volunteers can take it into the Volunteers/Staff Room for safe keeping.

## Smoking and Alcohol

The event and the venue has a no smoking policy. This applies to cigarettes, pipes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and vaporisers, and any method of consuming tobacco.

The University of Melbourne also has a no-smoking policy. This means that you will not be allowed to smoke outside the venue, on university grounds, or any place where it is marked "No Smoking". If you are caught smoking in these areas, you will be politely reminded about the no-smoking policy.

The event is a non-alcoholic event. Any alcoholic drinks will be confiscated by volunteers and/or the organisers. You will also be refused entry and/or asked to leave the venue if you are under the influence of alcohol.

## Tech Talks

There are a number of tech talks that have been scheduled on Saturday afternoon between 12:30pm and 3:00pm. These are 30 minute talks presented by some of our sponsors that are designed to help you with the competition, gain knowledge and/or refresh existing skills.

We ask that all participants attend at least one of the tech talks that have been scheduled. You can find what time and the topic of each of the Tech Talks in the [Schedule](schedule.md) that has been included in this document.

## Showers and Toilets

There are showers and toilets at the venue. We strongly encourage competitors to make use of these facilities during the competition. If you are planning to use the shower facilities in the venue, we ask that you take a quick shower to prevent a long wait for the showers.

If you need directions, please ask a volunteer and they will point you to the right direction.

## Sleeping

If you plan to sleep at the venue, please bring your own sleeping bag, pillow and other sleeping equipment. There will be a designated area for people to sleep. We ask that competitors that plan to work late at night to refrain from making any loud noises between 1am and 6am.

If you prefer to take a shower at home or sleep on a bed, then you will be given the option to leave for the night between 8:00pm and 10:00pm on Saturday July 30. Please be aware that once you leave the premises for the night, you cannot work on any part of your project from home or hotel. You must also return to the venue between 6:00am and 9:00am on Sunday morning.

## Leaving the Venue

You are free to leave and return to the venue during the daytime.

You are not allowed to leave and return to the venue during the night without the permission of the organisers, or under the following exceptions:

- Leaving to return home (between 8pm and 10pm)
- Leaving to have a smoke
- Family or medical emergencies
- Quitting the competition

In all cases, you will be required to hand in your badge to the organiser or a volunteer. This will ensure we know that you have left the venue. In addition, upon leaving, you are not allowed to continue working on your prototype until you return to the venue.

## Ownership of Code and Assets

Any intellectual property (e.g. code, images, audio) that you and/or your team
create during UNIHACK 2016 belongs to you. We may use your project to assist us
with marketing in future years, but we will always seek to permission from you
and/or your team in order to do so.

## Hardware

This year, some sponsors providing some hardware sensors to our teams to incorporate into their hacks. If you plan to use one of the Bosch sensors, we will also have some Arduino kits available for you to use.

Teams are advised that there are limited numbers and will be provided on a first-come-first-serve basis. If you wish to use some of the sensors, please ask a volunteer to see if there is any availability. Teams using the hardware must return it at the end of the event.

All documentation can be found at [handbook.unihack.net](../api/hardware.md)

You are free to bring your own food and drink to the event (e.g. Red Bull or
Mother energy drinks). We ask that you do not bring strong-smelling or pungent
food to the venue. Please also ensure that any containers that you bring are be
