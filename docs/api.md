## IBM Bluemix

![IBM Bluemix](../img/bluemix.png "Bluemix")

Welcome to the world of IBM! Welcome to the Bluemix Platform as a Service offering APIs covering areas such as Data Analytics, Mobile, Security and Integration. Welcome to Watson and the Internet of Things (IoT)!

Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data. Watson IoT offers the ability to securely connect devices to applications and industry solutions using cloud based services and rich analytics. You can check out all the services in this [catalogue](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/), but here are a couple to get you started. Imagine being able to find relationships between sentence components (nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.) with Relationship Extraction.

What could this mean for your course work? The Internet of Things Platform is the hub of all things IBM IoT, and it is where you can set up and manage your connected devices so that your apps can access live and historical data.

Keen to get started? Check out these [recipes](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/). Have fun! We look forward to meeting you at UNIHACK.

## Telstra SMS API

The SMS API sends and receives SMS messages to Australian mobile phones. You can also query the status of a previously sent SMS message. The API will assign a number for each message that is being sent. There is no ability to set your own number or use a shortcode.

There is a limit of 1000 free SMS messages per month and 100 per day. Higher volumes, up to 10,000 messages per month, may be purchased.

## Telstra Mobile Connect API

Mobile Connect allows you to provide social login to your application or service by allowing end users to use their mobile telephone to login and authenticate rather than the conventional username and password. Mobile Connect allows customers of all [participating mobile network operators](https://developer.mobileconnect.io/OperatorsPage) around the world to login in to your application, the relevant mobile operator is discovered via the Mobile Connect API Exchange.

Mobile Connect is easy to implement. This first release provides simple authentication for your application by using an SMS to and from your end users mobile phone as the authentication mechanism.

## Monash University

After the success of UNIHACK Mini and other student initiatives, Monash University is finally launching an API so you can easily access course and unit data. And all UNIHACK competitors will be the first ones to try it out!

All competitors should already have access to these accounts, so all you need to do is simply login with your email you provided to us for UNIHACK 2016.

More information about on how to consume these APIs - along with technical details such as sample requests, responses, error codes and stubbed endpoints that you can hit - can be found on its
 [developer portal](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/monash-university-1/#/portals/organizations/19264166-80b8-442c-a114-7a87c0d04e1c/apis/75535/versions/78644)

## Splunk

Splunk is a platform that captures indexes and correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.

Splunk is an excellent tool to make machine data (such as logs) accessible across an organization by identifying data patterns, providing metrics, diagnosing problems and providing intelligence for business operations. It is a horizontal technology used for application management, security and compliance, as well as business and web analytics.

Each of the systems that are being monitored generates logs that are forwarded to Splunk for indexing. Once indexed these logs are centralized and can be searched through the Splunk web interface, allowing issues to be easily investigated and knowledge extracted.

Splunk dashboards will be generated by built-in Simple XML dashboards because Simple XML provides a drag-and-drop layout editor, easy panel editor, as well as PDF printing support that we would otherwise lose using Splunk's other dashboard frameworks. The builder allows custom static files such as CSS and JavaScript to be included for different formatting styles and dynamic functionality.
